# First neuefische Project - Data Analysis

This project is centered around a dataset of house transactions in King County, Washington. 

As a stakeholder, Erin Robinson wants to "Invest in poor neighbourhood, buying & selling, costs back + little profit, socially responsible"

The project contains several deliverables:

* A [presentation](Presentatin_Kings_county_NK.pdf) for Erin Robinson 

* A [Jupyter Notebook](notebooks/Workbook.ipynb) that takes an EDA-tour and tries to come up with a good strategy and area to invest in for Erin Robinson. 

* In the scripts folder there are two python files, one for [training a linear model](scripts/train_model.py) and one to [make predictions](scripts/run_prediction.py) from that. 

* A pre-trained linear-regression model from the SeaTec district (zipcode 98188)

Have fun!
